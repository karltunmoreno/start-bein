## Overview
Using a NoSQL database, Start bein's Mongoose models sync with its MongoDB database and React components so it can easily scale exponentially.  Although a brand new start-up, we go beyond all talk, thoughts, and prayers. Start bein promotes activity within and contribution to to the world at home and abroad. So, stop talkin, start bein!

  ## Description
  * Did anyone else notice the animals venturing out into our locked down cities during the early days of Covid? What about the blue skies visible again in notoriously smoggy cities?
  * Social media apps have been a great resource for thinking, but what about being? We all know the cliche, "To be or not to be." Start bein advocates a balance between thinking and doing things as a way to start bein.
  * Let's face it, a safe place to pitch a topic or activity with the goal of positive "bein" by doing can only help balance the hardships broadcast daily.  It is not to ignore reality, but change a small part of your world one bein at a time. 
  * The best aspect of the code presented is that it builds both virtual and physical places to interact and make a difference. We use both external and internal data sources to promote the overall foundation of the app.
  * "It's not easy bein green as transformed.  Now it's about time to 'Start bein" in the world.

  ## Installation
  * As a full stack M-E-R-N application, there is no special installation required for the general us of the start-bein app. Technologies incorporated are a part of the thrird and final project of the six month odyssey of the full-stack bootcamp sponsored by the University of Miami:
  Use React for the front end.

>Use GraphQL with a Node.js and Express.js server.

Use MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM for the database.

Use queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

Have a polished UI.

Be responsive.

Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

Include authentication (JWT).

Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, etc.).

Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
